_Identity federation_ enables single sign-on with BlueXP so that users can log in using credentials from your corporate identity. To get started, learn how identity federation works with BlueXP and then review an overview of the setup process.

== How identity federation works

Setting up identity federation creates a trust connection between BlueXP's authentication service provider (auth0) and your own identity management provider.

The following image depicts how identity federation works with BlueXP:

image:diagram-identity-federation.png[A diagram that shows a user authenticating with BlueXP and a connection between BlueXP and an identity provider that authenticates the user.]

. A user enters their email address on the BlueXP login page.
. BlueXP identifies that the email domain is part of a federated connection and sends the authentication request to the identity provider using the trusted connection.
+
When you set up a federated connection, BlueXP always uses that federated connection for authentication.
. The user authenticates by using credentials from your corporate directory.
. Your identity provider authenticates the user's identity and the user is logged in to BlueXP.

Identity federation uses open standards, such as Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0 (SAML) and OpenID Connect (OIDC).

== Supported identity providers

BlueXP supports the following identity providers:

* Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) identity providers
* Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AD)
* Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS)
* PingFederate

BlueXP supports service provider initiated (SP-initiated) SSO only. Identity provider initiated (IdP-initiated) SSO is not supported.

== Overview of the setup process

Before you set up a connection between BlueXP and your identity management provider, you should understand the steps that you'll need to take so that you can prepare accordingly.

=== SAML identity provider

At a high-level, setting up a federated connection between BlueXP and a SAML identity provider includes the following steps:

| Step
| Completed by
| Description


| 1 | Active Directory (AD) admin a| Configure your SAML identity provider according to the guidelines in the auth0 documentation.

View instructions for your SAML identity provider:

If your identity provider doesn't appear in the list above, https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/saml/saml-sso-integrations/configure-auth0-saml-service-provider[follow these generic instructions^]

TIP: Do _not_ complete the steps that describe how to create a connection with auth0. You'll create that connection in the next step.

| 2 | BlueXP admin a| Go to the https://services.cloud.netapp.com/federation-setup[NetApp Federation Setup page^] and create the connection with BlueXP.

To complete this step, you need to obtain the following from your AD admin about the identity provider: 

* Sign in URL
* An X509 signing certificate (PEM or CER format)
* Sign out URL (optional)

After you create the connection using this information, the Federation Setup page lists the parameters that you can send to your AD admin to complete the configuration in the next step.

| 3 | AD admin | Complete the configuration on the identity provider using the parameters shown on the Federation Setup page after finishing step 2.

| 4 | BlueXP admin | Test and enable the connection from the https://services.cloud.netapp.com/federation-setup[NetApp Federation Setup page^]

Note that the page refreshes between testing the connection and enabling the connection.

=== Microsoft Azure AD

At a high-level, setting up a federated connection between BlueXP and Azure AD includes the following steps:

[cols="10,15,75",width=100%,options="header"]

| Step
| Completed by
| Description

| 1 | AD admin a| Create a new application in Azure Active Directory along with a client secret.

| 2 | BlueXP admin a| Go to the https://services.cloud.netapp.com/federation-setup[NetApp Federation Setup page^] and create the connection with BlueXP.

To complete this step, you need to obtain the following from your AD admin: 

* Client ID
* Client secret value
* Microsoft Azure AD domain

After you create the connection using this information, the Federation Setup page lists the parameters that you can send to your AD admin to complete the configuration in the next step.

| 3 | AD admin | Complete the configuration in Azure AD using the parameters shown on the Federation Setup page after finishing step 2.

== Updating a federated connection

After the BlueXP admin enables a connection, the admin can update the connection at any time from the https://services.cloud.netapp.com/federation-setup[NetApp Federation Setup page^] 

For example, you might need to update the connection by uploading a new certificate.

The BlueXP admin who created the connection is the only authorized user who can update the connection. If you'd like to add additional admins, you can contact us through the in-product chat.
