.. Complete the steps on the *Subscription Assignment* page:
+
NOTE: If someone from your organization has already subscribed to the NetApp BlueXP subscription from your billing account, then you will be redirected to https://bluexp.netapp.com/ontap-cloud?x-gcp-marketplace-token=[the Cloud Volumes ONTAP page on the BlueXP website^] instead. If this is unexpected, contact your NetApp sales team. Google enables only one subscription per Google billing account.
+
* Select the BlueXP accounts that you'd like to associate this subscription with.
* In the *Replace existing subscription* field, choose whether you'd like to automatically replace the existing subscription for one account with this new subscription.
+
BlueXP replaces the existing subscription for all credentials in the account with this new subscription. If a set of credentials wasn't ever associated with a subscription, then this new subscription won't be associated with those credentials.
+
For all other accounts, you'll need to manually associate the subscription by repeating these steps.

* Select *Save*.
