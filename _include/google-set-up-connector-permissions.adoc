A Google Cloud service account is required to provide the Connector with the permissions that BlueXP needs to manage resources in Google Cloud. When you create the Connector, you'll need to associate this service account with the Connector VM.

.Steps

. Create a custom role in Google Cloud:

.. Create a YAML file that includes the contents of the link:reference-permissions-gcp.html[service account permissions for the Connector].

.. From Google Cloud, activate cloud shell.

.. Upload the YAML file that includes the required permissions.

.. Create a custom role by using the `gcloud iam roles create` command.
+
The following example creates a role named "connector" at the project level:
+
`gcloud iam roles create connector --project=myproject --file=connector.yaml`
+

. Create a service account in Google Cloud and assign the role to the service account:

.. From the IAM & Admin service, select *Service Accounts > Create Service Account*.

.. Enter service account details and select *Create and Continue*.

.. Select the role that you just created.

.. Finish the remaining steps to create the role.

. If you plan to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in different projects than the project where the Connector resides, then you'll need to provide the Connector's service account with access to those projects.
+
For example, let's say the Connector is in project 1 and you want to create Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in project 2. You'll need to grant access to the service account in project 2.

.. From the IAM & Admin service, select the Google Cloud project where you want to create Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems.

.. On the *IAM* page, select *Grant Access* and provide the required details.
+
* Enter the email of the Connector's service account.
* Select the Connector's custom role.
* Select *Save*.

.Result

The service account for the Connector VM is set up.
