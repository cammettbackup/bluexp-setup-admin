summary: Subscribe to BlueXP from your cloud provider's marketplace to pay for BlueXP services at an hourly rate or through an annual contract. If you purchased a license from NetApp, you also need to subscribe to the marketplace offering. Your license is always charged first, but you'll be charged at the hourly rate if you exceed your licensed capacity or if the license's term expires.
