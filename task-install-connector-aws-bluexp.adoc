To create a Connector in AWS from BlueXP, you need to set up your networking, prepare AWS permissions, and then create the Connector.

.Before you begin

You should review link:reference-limitations.html[Connector limitations].

== Step 1: Set up networking

Ensure that the network location where you plan to install the Connector supports the following requirements. Meeting these requirements enables the Connector to manage resources and processes within your hybrid cloud environment.

//Connections to target networks

//Connections to target networks
include::_include/networking.adoc[tag=networks]

//Outbound internet access
include::_include/networking.adoc[tag=outbound]

//Outbound internet access

//Endpoints contacted from the Connector

|===

//Proxy server
include::_include/networking.adoc[tag=proxy]

//Ports
include::_include/networking.adoc[tag=ports]

== Step 2: Set up AWS permissions

BlueXP needs to authenticate with AWS before it can deploy the Connector instance in your VPC. You can choose one of these authentication methods:

* Let BlueXP assume an IAM role that has the required permissions
* Provide an AWS access key and secret key for an IAM user who has the required permissions

With either option, the first step is to create an IAM policy. This policy contains only the permissions needed to launch the Connector instance in AWS from BlueXP.

If needed, you can restrict the IAM policy by using the IAM `Condition` element. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition.html[AWS documentation: Condition element^]

TIP: When BlueXP creates the Connector, it applies a new set of permissions to the Connector instance that enables the Connector to manage AWS resources.

.Steps

. Go to the AWS IAM console.

. Select *Policies > Create policy*.

. Select *JSON*.

. Copy and paste the following policy:

                "kms:ListAliases"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:TerminateInstances"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "StringLike": {
                    "ec2:ResourceTag/OCCMInstance": "*"
                }
            },
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

. Select *Next* and add tags, if needed.

. Select *Next* and enter a name and description.

. Select *Create policy*.

. Either attach the policy to an IAM role that BlueXP can assume or to an IAM user so that you can provide BlueXP with access keys:

* (Option 1) Set up an IAM role that BlueXP can assume:
+
.. Go to the AWS IAM console in the target account.

.. Under Access Management, select *Roles > Create Role* and follow the steps to create the role.

.. Under *Trusted entity type*, select *AWS account*.

.. Select *Another AWS account* and enter the ID of the BlueXP SaaS account: 952013314444

.. Select the policy that you created in the previous section.

.. After you create the role, copy the Role ARN so that you can paste it in BlueXP when you create the Connector.

* (Option 2) Set up permissions for an IAM user so that you can provide BlueXP with access keys:
+
.. From the AWS IAM console, select *Users* and then select the user name.

.. Select *Add permissions > Attach existing policies directly*.

.. Select the policy that you created.

.. Select *Next* and then select *Add permissions*.

.. Ensure that you have the access key and secret key for the IAM user.

.Result

You should now have an IAM role that has the required permissions or an IAM user that has the required permissions. When you create the Connector from BlueXP, you can provide information about the role or access keys.

== Step 3: Create the Connector

Create the Connector directly from the BlueXP web-based console.

.About this task

Creating the Connector from BlueXP deploys an EC2 instance in AWS using a default configuration. link:reference-connector-default-config.html[Learn about the default configuration for the Connector]. 

.Before you begin

You should have the following:

* An AWS authentication method: either an IAM role or access keys for an IAM user with the required permissions.

* A VPC and subnet that meets networking requirements.

* A key pair for the EC2 instance.

* Details about a proxy server, if a proxy is required for internet access from the Connector.

.Steps

. Select the *Connector* drop-down and select *Add Connector*.
+
image:screenshot_connector_add.gif[A screenshot that shows the Connector icon in the header and the Add Connector action.]

. Choose *Amazon Web Services* as your cloud provider and select *Continue*.

. On the *Deploying a Connector* page, review the details about what you'll need. You have two options:

.. Select *Continue* to prepare for deployment by using the in-product guide. Each step in the in-product guide includes the information that's contained on this page of the documentation.

.. Select *Skip to Deployment* if you already prepared by following the steps on this page.

. Follow the steps in the wizard to create the Connector:

* *Get Ready*: Review what you'll need.

* *AWS Credentials*: Specify your AWS region and then choose an authentication method, which is either an IAM role that BlueXP can assume or an AWS access key and secret key.
+
TIP: If you choose *Assume Role*, you can create the first set of credentials from the Connector deployment wizard. Any additional set of credentials must be created from the Credentials page. They will then be available from the wizard in a drop-down list. link:task-adding-aws-accounts.html[Learn how to add additional credentials].

* *Details*: Provide details about the Connector.
+
** Enter a name for the instance.
** Add custom tags (metadata) to the instance.
** Choose whether you want BlueXP to create a new role that has the required permissions, or if you want to select an existing role that you set up with link:reference-permissions-aws.html[the required permissions].
** Choose whether you want to encrypt the Connector's EBS disks. You have the option to use the default encryption key or to use a custom key.

* *Network*: Specify a VPC, subnet, and key pair for the instance, choose whether to enable a public IP address, and optionally specify a proxy configuration.
+
Make sure that you have the correct key pair to use with the Connector. Without a key pair, you will not be able to access the Connector virtual machine.

* *Security Group*: Choose whether to create a new security group or whether to select an existing security group that allows the required inbound and outbound rules.
+
link:reference-ports-aws.html[View security group rules for AWS].

* *Review*: Review your selections to verify that your set up is correct.

. Select *Add*.
+
The instance should be ready in about 7 minutes. You should stay on the page until the process is complete.

.Result

After the process is complete, the Connector is available for use from BlueXP.
