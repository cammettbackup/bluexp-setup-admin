== Manage your account with the Tenancy API

If you want to manage your account settings by sending API requests, then you'll need to use the _Tenancy_ API. This API is different than the BlueXP API, which you use to create and manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environments.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-automation/tenancy/overview.html[View endpoints for the Tenancy API^]

== Create and manage users

The user's in your account can access and manage the resources in specific workspaces.

=== Add users

Associate users with your BlueXP account so those users can create and manage working environments in BlueXP.

.Steps

. If the user hasn't already done so, ask the user to go to https://bluexp.netapp.com/[NetApp BlueXP website^] and sign up.

. From the top of BlueXP, select the *Account* drop-down.
+

. select *Manage Account* next to the currently selected account.
+
image:screenshot-manage-account-settings.png[A screenshot that shows the Manage Account Settings option that's available from the Account drop-down.]

. From the Members tab, select *Associate User*.

. Enter the user's email address and select a role for the user:
+
* *Account Admin*: Can perform any action in BlueXP.
* *Workspace Admin*: Can create and manage resources in assigned workspaces.
* *Compliance Viewer*: Can only view compliance information for BlueXP classification and generate reports for workspaces that they have permission to access.

. If you selected Workspace Admin or Compliance Viewer, select one or more workspaces to associate with that user.
+
image:screenshot_associate_user.gif[A screenshot that shows how to associate a user by selecting a role and the associated workspaces.]

. Select *Associate*.

.Result

The user should receive an email from NetApp BlueXP titled "Account Association." The email includes the information needed to access BlueXP.

=== Remove users

Disassociating a user makes it so they can no longer access the resources in a BlueXP account.

.Steps

. From the top of BlueXP, select the *Account* drop-down and select *Manage Account*.
+
image:screenshot-manage-account-settings.png[A screenshot that shows the Manage Account Settings option that's available from the Account drop-down.]

. Select *Disassociate User* and select *Disassociate* to confirm.

.Result

The user can no longer access the resources in this BlueXP account.

=== Manage a Workspace Admin's workspaces

You can associate and disassociate Workspace Admins with workspaces at any time. Associating the user enables them to create and view the working environments in that workspace.

NOTE: You also need to associate the Connector with workspaces so Workspace Admins can access those workspaces from BlueXP. link:task-managing-netapp-accounts.html#manage-a-connectors-workspaces[Learn how to manage a Connector's workspaces].

.Steps

. From the top of BlueXP, select the *Account* drop-down and select *Manage Account*.

image:screenshot_associate_user_workspace.png[A screenshot that shows the action menu that is available when hovering over a user's name in the Users table.]

. Select *Manage Workspaces*.

. Select the workspaces to associate with the user and select *Apply*.

.Result

The user can now access those workspaces from BlueXP, as long as the Connector was also associated with the workspaces.

== Create and manage service accounts

A service account acts as a "user" that can make authorized API calls to BlueXP for automation purposes. This makes it easier to manage automation because you don't need to build automation scripts based on a real person's user account who can leave the company at any time. And if you're using federation, you can create a token without generating a refresh token from the cloud.

You give permissions to a service account by assigning it a role, just like any other BlueXP user. You can also associate the service account with specific workspaces in order to control the working environments (resources) that the service can access.

When you create the service account, BlueXP enables you to copy or download a client ID and client secret for the service account. This key pair is used for authentication with BlueXP.

=== Create a service account

Create as many service accounts as you need to manage the resources in your working environments.

.Steps

. From the top of BlueXP, select the *Account* drop-down.
+
image:screenshot-account-settings-menu.png[A screenshot that shows the Account Settings option in the top banner of BlueXP.]

. Select *Manage Account* next to the currently selected account.
+
image:screenshot-manage-account-settings.png[A screenshot that shows the Manage Account Settings option that's available from the Account drop-down.]

. From the Members tab, select *Create Service Account*.

. Enter a name and select a role. If you chose a role other than Account Admin, choose the workspace to associate with this service account.

. Select *Create*.

. Copy or download the client ID and client secret.
+
The client secret is visible only once and is not stored anywhere by BlueXP. Copy or download the secret and store it safely.

. Select *Close*.

=== Obtain a bearer token for a service account

In order to make API calls to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-automation/tenancy/overview.html[Tenancy API^], you'll need to obtain a bearer token for a service account.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-automation/platform/create_service_token.html[Learn how to create a service account token^]

=== Copy the client ID

You can copy a service account's client ID at any time.

.Steps

. From the Members tab, select the action menu in the row that corresponds to the service account.
+
image:screenshot_service_account_actions.gif[A screenshot that shows the action menu that is available when hovering over a user's name in the Users table.]

. Select *Client ID*.

. The ID is copied to your clipboard.

=== Recreate keys

Recreating the key will delete the existing key for this service account and then create a new key. You won't be able to use the previous key.

.Steps

. From the Members tab, select the action menu in the row that corresponds to the service account.
+
image:screenshot_service_account_actions.gif[A screenshot that shows the action menu that is available when hovering over a user's name in the Users table.]

. Select *Recreate Key*.

. Select *Recreate* to confirm.

. Copy or download the client ID and client secret.
+
The client secret is visible only once and is not stored anywhere by BlueXP. Copy or download the secret and store it safely.

. Select *Close*.

=== Delete a service account

Delete a service account if you no longer need to use it.

.Steps

. From the Members tab, select the action menu in the row that corresponds to the service account.
+
image:screenshot_service_account_actions.gif[A screenshot that shows the action menu that is available when hovering over a user's name in the Users table.]

. Select *Delete*.

. Select *Delete* again to confirm.

== Manage workspaces

Manage your workspaces by creating, renaming, and deleting them. Note that you can't delete a workspace if it contains any resources. It must be empty.

.Steps

. From the top of BlueXP, select the *Account* drop-down and select *Manage Account*.

. Select *Workspaces*.

. Choose one of the following options:
+
* Select *Add New Workspace* to create a new workspace.
* Select *Rename* to rename the workspace.
* Select *Delete* to delete the workspace.

+
If you created a new workspace, you must also add the Connector to that workspace. If you don't add the Connector, then Workspace Admins can't access any of the resources in the workspace. Refer to the following section for more details.

== Manage a Connector's workspaces

You need to associate the Connector with workspaces so Workspace Admins can access those workspaces from BlueXP.

If you only have Account Admins, then associating the Connector with workspaces isn't required. Account Admins have the ability to access all workspaces in BlueXP by default.

link:concept-netapp-accounts.html[Learn more about users, workspaces, and Connectors].

.Steps

. From the top of BlueXP, select the *Account* drop-down and select *Manage Account*.

.Steps

. From the top of BlueXP, select the *Account* drop-down and select *Manage Account*.

. In the *Overview* tab, enable the *Allow Third Party Services* setting.
